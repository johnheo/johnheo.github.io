abstract = {This paper introduces the sparse periodic systolic (SPS) dataflow, which advances the state-of-the-art hardware accelerator for supporting lightweight neural networks. Specifically, the SPS dataflow enables a novel hardware design approach unlocked by an emergent pruning scheme, periodic pattern-based sparsity (PPS). By exploiting the regularity of PPS, our sparsity-aware compiler optimally reorders the weights and uses a simple indexing unit in hardware to create matches between the weights and activations. Through the compiler-hardware codesign, SPS dataflow enjoys higher degrees of parallelism while being free of the high indexing overhead and without model accuracy loss. Evaluated on popular benchmarks such as VGG and ResNet, the SPS dataflow and accompanying neural network compiler outperform prior work in convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerator designs targeting FPGA devices. Against other sparsity-supporting weight storage formats, SPS results in 4.49 \texttimes{} energy efficiency gain while lowering storage requirements by 3.67 \texttimes{} for total weight storage (non-pruned weights plus indexing) and 22,044 \texttimes{} for indexing memory.},

abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, has made significant strides in the past decade. Due to the widely applicable nature of this technology, the emergence of increasingly intelligent machines is poised to transform today’s society. Recently, the rate of AI development has aroused significant concerns due to the lack of guiding policy and regulation. Thus, it is integral for the public to recognize the technology and make informed choices regarding the future of AI. This paper serves to acquaint the layperson and other stakeholders involved in AI development with the current progress of AI and the ethical concerns that must be addressed before significant advancements. The subject of discussion is narrowed down to three fields of AI’s most prominent use: (1) the internet; (2) the automotive industry; and (3) the healthcare industry. For each sector, the foundation of the domainspecific AI technique is introduced, the benefits and ethical ramifications are discussed, and a final cost-benefit analysis is provided.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
