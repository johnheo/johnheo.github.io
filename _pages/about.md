I am a recent graduate of the University of Southern California (c/o 2023) with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. 

I am grateful to have been advised by [Prof. Massoud Pedram](https://mpedram.com/) at [USC Viterbi](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/), working on efficient deep learning computing ranging from algorithms to software-hardware co-design. I am also fortunate to have worked with [Dr. Dongsoo Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ALiieEkAAAAJ&hl=en) from [Naver Corporation](https://www.navercorp.com/), [Prof. Song Han](https://hanlab.mit.edu/songhan) from [MIT EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/), and [Prof. Hyunjoo Lee](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/professor/12365/) from [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/). 

My research interests broadly lie in **efficient AI computing (model compression, data-efficient learning).** I am also interested in the social implications of AI, which inspired me to co-found [Shift SC](https://www.shiftsc.org/) and develop/teach the AI Ethics Curriculum. In my free time, I love playing sports, especially tennis, soccer, and skiing. [My Curriculum Vitae](assets/heocv.pdf).
