I am a recent graduate of the University of Southern California with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and Computer Science, seeking PhD programs starting Fall 2025. I am currently serving at the [8th US Army](https://www.army.mil/8tharmy) as part of my Korean military service.  

I am grateful to have been advised by [Prof. Massoud Pedram](https://mpedram.com/) at [USC Viterbi](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/), working on efficient deep learning computing ranging from algorithms to hardware design. I am also fortunate to have worked with [Dr. Dongsoo Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ALiieEkAAAAJ&hl=en) from [NAVER Cloud](https://www.ncloud.com/), [Prof. Song Han](https://hanlab.mit.edu/songhan) from [MIT EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/), and [Prof. Hyunjoo Lee](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/professor/12365/) from [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/). 

My research interests broadly lie in efficient AI computing (model compression, data-efficient learning) and am also interested AI+X applications in Science and Finance.
